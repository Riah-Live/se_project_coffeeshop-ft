# Coffeeshop Landing Page Project

## Project description

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would love to learn how to include customer feedback functionality so they have the option to suggest specialty drink recipes or even something as simple as an aestically pleasing rating widget to track customer satisfaction.
